## üí° Usage Tips

### For Midjourney
- Add `--ar 16:9` for wide formats, `--ar 1:1` for square
- Add `--style raw` for more literal interpretations
- Use `--v 6` for latest model features

### For DALL¬∑E
- Be explicit about "flat design" and "no shadows"
- Specify "vector style" if you want clean graphics
- Request "high contrast" for visibility

### For Claude
- Use for generating variations of text-based designs
- Great for layout descriptions and component specs
- Can help refine prompts before sending to image generators

### For Stable Diffusion
- Add "professional" and "clean" to descriptions
- Include negative prompts: "no gradients, no 3D, no shadows"
- Specify resolution requirements explicitly
