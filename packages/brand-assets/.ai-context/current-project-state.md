3. Design 10 essential UI icons
4. Build 2-3 social media announcement templates

### Priority 2 (Next Week)
1. Complete icon library (30 total icons)
2. Create all social platform templates
3. Design blackjack card suite (52 cards + back)

## Decisions Needed 🤔

### Design Decisions
- [ ] Final logo variant selection (need 3-5 options first)
- [ ] Icon style: filled vs. outline (or both?)
- [ ] Social media template format (static vs. template layer)
- [ ] Card design approach (realistic vs. minimalist)

### Technical Decisions
- [ ] Use Git LFS for all images or just large files?
- [ ] Export retina (@2x) versions of all rasters?
- [ ] Create light theme variants?
- [ ] Set up automated optimization pipeline?

## Known Issues / Blockers 🚧

- None currently

## Notes & Context 📝

### Brand Direction
- Flat minimalist style (NO shadows, NO gradients except brand)
- High contrast for accessibility
- Dark-first design (primary surface: #0F1117)
- Gaming-inspired but professional

### Asset Strategy
- SVG first for scalability
- PNG fallbacks for compatibility
- Optimize all files before finalizing
- Document every generation with prompts

### AI Collaboration
- Using Claude for SVG/HTML generation
- Midjourney for atmospheric/artistic assets
- DALL·E for precise compositions
- All prompts saved in `assets/source/prompts-used/`

## Recent Activity 📅

### [Current Date]
- Initialized repository structure
- Created AI context files
- Set up documentation framework
- Ready to begin asset generation
